Diffie –Hellman algorithm and ICMP

The Code implementation is done using tcl scripting.
And the results are tested using NS2 simulator.

I have analyzed effect of selective packet drop attack on delay and throughput in adhoc networking using AODV protocol.
Find new path and enhance network efficiency by implementing Key distribution method with Diffie –Hellman algorithm and ICMP.
And compare and analyze the enhanced algorithm in terms of packet loss, throughput and delay.
